Required development Environment
---------------------------------
node
NPM
Angular Cli
text editor

to check npm version ->   npm --version
to install cli -> npm install -g @angular/cli  
to check the angular installed or not or to see version --> ng --version
ng new "projectname" --> to create appication.
to create a component --> ng g c nameofthecomponent
to create a component with inline template and inline style --> ng g c nameofthecomponent -it -is --skipTests=true
if it is not working u can add this below code in angular.json file
  "schematics": {
    "@schematics/angular:component": {
      "style": "scss",
      "inlineTemplate": true,
      "inlineStyle": true
    }
  }   
interpolation means sending data from class to view using {{}} -- refer test component and p1 component

Without property binding Boolean values not work with interpolation. 
variable value --> [attribute]= "value"  i.e., we assign the value to the attribute by [].

for multiple class binding need to use ngclass
event binding means ex: click event that is when we click something will be happen

template reference variable #variable_name in the template and  #variable_name's value we refer


ngIf Example
<h1*ngIf=true; else elseblock >hi<h1>
<ng-template #elseblock>i am else</ng-template>


ngSwitch Example
<div [ngSwitch]="choice">
    <li *ngSwitchCase="'one'">1</li>
    <li *ngSwitchCase="'two'">2</li>
    <li *ngSwitchCase="'three'">3</li>
    <li *ngSwitchDefault>default</li>
</div>

ngFor example
<div *ngFor="let x of items">
<h1>{{X}}</h1>
</div>
